In this study we want to learn more about how humans make reward-based decisions.

### What we ask you to do

We built a task in which you will have to repeatedly make decisions between two different options we present to you.
Based on your choice you will collect points.
You goal will be to collect as many points as possible which will be rewarded with a **bonus payment**.

### Requirements for approval:

- read the instructions and consent form carefully
- pass a set of easy multiple choice questions before the experiment starts
- remain in full-screen mode for the entire duration of the experiment

### Bonus payment

A bonus payment will be made based on the amount of points collected during the task.
The range of the bonus payment is **between 0 and 3 GBP**, the latter reflecting a completely flawless performance.
The bonus has to be calculated manually so it will be paid to you with a slight delay but as soon as possible.
