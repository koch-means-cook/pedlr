# Half-way data quality assessment

We looked at data quality with 39 participants (9 OA, 30 YA).
For this we took two measures.

1. Accuracy in guided choice trials
2. Estimation of bandit 1 vs. bandit 3

## Accuracy in guided choice trials

Participants making a lot of errors in the simple guided choice trials ('pick option that has a frame around it') are likely to not pay attention.
We set a boundary of 75% accuracy during these trials to mark suspicious participants.
We could find two participants that did more mistakes than this threshold.
All other participants stay above 88.5% accuracy.
See data sheet for details.

## Estimation of bandit 1 vs. bandit 3

Bandit 1 and 3 represent two different, completely separate Gaussian distributions.
They should be easy to tell apart.
If these two bandits cannot be told apart during estimation trials this is an indication the participant did not pay attention.
We therefore conducted within-subject, paired t-test between estimations of bandit 1 and 3.
If the test did not indicate a significant difference between bandit 1 and 3 we marked the participant as suspicious and probably not paying attention.
We also looked at accuracy levels of choices involving bandit 1 vs. bandit 3 and saw that the bad accuracy levels are mostly aligned with bad estimation patterns.
This likely shows that estimation patterns were not independent of choice accuracies.
